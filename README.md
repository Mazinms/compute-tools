# compute-tools
Support tools for the Interactive Computing Workflow.

This includes two Arch Linux PKGBUILD files:

* `ww.pkgbuild` - This is the core interactive workflow package.  Really, it is only dependencies on the base tools needed by the workflow.

* `basic.pkgbuild` - This is a simple desktop environment that includes all the workflow tools.  It also installs some sane defaults into your `.tmux.conf`, `.vimrc`, etc.
